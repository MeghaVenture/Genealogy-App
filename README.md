A family tree app that:
  1 - uses my family tree numbering system

  3 - creates a database of family tree members and their details that can be seached or organized.
  4 - output a familytree as a file that can be easily read and shared with others (with the ability to cut out 'personal' information from the record (like living relatives etc).
